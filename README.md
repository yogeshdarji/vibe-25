# CTF Social Engineering Tools

Educational tools for understanding social engineering vulnerabilities in CTF challenges.

## Overview

This repository contains templates and examples for CTF (Capture The Flag) challenges that involve social engineering AI systems. These tools are for educational purposes to understand security vulnerabilities.

## Files

### Safe Templates (Can be committed)
- `ctf_attack_template.py` - Generic attack template without sensitive data
- `README.md` - This documentation

### Local Files (DO NOT COMMIT)
- Any files containing:
  - API keys
  - IP addresses
  - Passwords
  - Team-specific information
  - Attack results

## Usage

1. Copy the template files
2. Add your specific configuration (API keys, IPs, etc.)
3. Run locally - do not commit configured files

## Security Notes

- Never commit real API keys
- Never commit IP addresses
- Never commit passwords
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files

## Educational Purpose

These tools demonstrate:
- Social engineering techniques in CTF environments
- API vulnerability testing
- Security awareness training

## Disclaimer

These tools are for authorized CTF competitions and educational purposes only. Do not use for unauthorized access or malicious purposes.

## Best Practices for CTF

1. **Offensive**: Learn how attacks work
2. **Defensive**: Understand how to protect against them
3. **Ethical**: Only use in authorized environments

## Contributing

When contributing:
- Only submit generic templates
- Remove all sensitive data
